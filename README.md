# screenshot_ocr
As the name suggests, an application for copying on-screen text to clipboard by taking a screenshot.
The overall purpose here is to create a relatively user-friendly interface for developers to use pre-built methods
to utilize existing open-source ocr tools in python within their projects without having to worry about the internal
details. This will also eventually contain a command line tool and a GUI for more user-friendly versatility.
